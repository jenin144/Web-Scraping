***Overview***

```
The script is designed to scrape anime data from MyAnimeList (MAL) and IMDb using a combination

of Selenium for dynamic content and BeautifulSoup for parsing static HTML content. It leverages multithreading to efficiently scrape multiple pages in parallel and aggregates the data into a

 CSV file for further analysis.
